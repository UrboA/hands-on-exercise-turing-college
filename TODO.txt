# Bugs to Fix
[ ] Running main.py results in an error. Figure out why, and fix it.

# Required Refactoring
[ ] Add comprehensive type hints and make mypy pass in strict mode (`mypy dndgame --strict`)
    [ ] Add proper types for all class attributes
    [ ] Add return types and parameter types for all methods
    [ ] Fix any type-related issues mypy finds
[ ] Code is not optimized for adding a new character class. Fix this, and add a new character.

[ ] Input validation for user input

[ ] Improve OOP Structure:
    [ ] Create an Enemy class
    [ ] Refactor Character and Enemy classes to use a common Entity base class
    [ ] Create Goblin class inheriting from Enemy
    [ ] Update the Combat class to use the new classes
    [ ] Replace simple_combat function with Combat class usage

[ ] Convert loops to functional programming
    [ ] Use list comprehensions where appropriate
    [ ] Use map()/filter() where appropriate

[ ] Add complete docstrings
    [ ] Class docstrings explaining purpose and attributes
    [ ] Method docstrings with parameters and return types
    [ ] Add examples in docstrings where helpful

# Features to Add
[ ] Add critical hit system (natural roll of 20)
[ ] Create Adventure class to manage game flow
    [ ] Move game loop from main.py to Adventure class
    [ ] Design your own structure for managing:
        - Character creation
        - Combat encounters
        - Game menu and choices
        - Character display
        - Any other game logic, or ideas you have

# Testing
[ ] Add comprehensive unit tests
    [ ] Test dice rolling mechanics
    [ ] Test character creation and stats
    [ ] Test combat system
    [ ] Mock random number generation for reliable tests
    [ ] Achieve 90% test coverage

# Optional Stretch Goals
[ ] Add different weapon types with different damage dice
[ ] Add simple spellcasting system
[ ] Add an experience points and leveling system
[ ] (Advanced) Create a DungeonMaster class which uses OpenAI's API to narrate the game (start simple with just narrating the comabt, extend it to narrate the choices and actions of the players)
