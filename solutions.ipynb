If you struggle, read the codeblock once to get a rough idea of what it should look like, close this window and try to continue writing the code / solution. Repeat this quick scan of the code block everytime you feel stuck until you manage to write code / solution that you feel you understand and which does what you want it to do based on the descriptions given. Check the suggested code block afterwards to confirm everything is correct and continue to the next section afterwards.\n",
